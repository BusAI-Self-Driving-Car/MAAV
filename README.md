# AutonomousBraking
Work towards an autonomous braking system.

## Objectives
### Detection

- Pedestrian detection

Location:
2d can be done with:
- ROLO
- YOLO
- SSD

3d:
- David's trick
- FCRN/FCN

Motion:
- ROLO
- KALMAN FILTERS


## TODO (Monday april 2nd)
### Detection
- Detection/Tracking runnable on GPU
- Depth (may be harder)
### RL
- Setup DeepGTAV
- Setup base RL learning
- handcrafted
